# Autoware Planning Simulator Test

This directory contains test scripts for `dump_launch` and `play_launch` with Autoware planning simulator.

## Setup

1. **Create the autoware symlink** pointing to your Autoware workspace:
   ```bash
   ln -s /path/to/your/autoware autoware
   ```

   The symlink should point to a built Autoware workspace containing `install/setup.bash`.

2. **Ensure you have the required map data**:
   ```bash
   # The script expects the sample map at:
   $HOME/autoware_map/sample-map-planning
   ```

3. **Systemd user services** are available for running Autoware as a managed service (no additional installation required):
   - Automatic process cleanup when stopping the service
   - Log management via journalctl
   - Service status monitoring
   - No orphan ROS nodes after stopping

## Usage

### Using justfile (Recommended)

```bash
# Show available recipes
just --list

# Start Autoware simulator with systemd-run (runs as systemd user service)
just start-sim

# Manage the simulator service
just status-sim    # Check service status
just logs-sim      # View logs (follows in real-time)
just stop-sim      # Stop the service

# Run autonomous driving test (requires simulator running)
just drive

# Start complete demo (simulator + autonomous test) as systemd service
just start-demo

# Manage the demo service
just status-demo  - Check demo service status
just logs-demo    - View demo logs (follows in real-time)
just restart-demo - Restart the demo service
just stop-demo    - Stop the demo service

# Clean up orphan ROS nodes
just kill-orphans
```

The justfile automatically sources the Autoware environment from `autoware/install/setup.bash`.

### Systemd Launch Benefits

When using `just start-sim` or `just start-demo`, the launch runs as a systemd user service, which provides several advantages:

1. **Automatic Cleanup**: All ROS nodes are properly terminated when the service is stopped (no orphan processes)
2. **Log Management**: Logs are stored in journalctl and can be viewed with `just logs-sim` or `just logs-demo`
3. **Service Monitoring**: Check service status with `just status-sim` or `just status-demo`
4. **Persistent Logs**: Logs are preserved even after the service stops

The systemd services automatically handle environment setup (sources Autoware workspace) and CycloneDDS configuration.

### Using Scripts Directly

```bash
# Start simulator
bash scripts/start-sim.sh

# Run autonomous driving test (requires simulator running)
python3 scripts/test_autonomous_drive.py
```

## Autonomous Driving Test

### Quick Start - Automated Demo

Run the complete demo sequence as a systemd service:

```bash
just start-demo
```

This will:
1. Start Autoware with `play_launch launch` (via systemd service)
2. Wait for system to be ready (~60s)
3. Set initial pose
4. Set goal pose
5. Engage autonomous mode
6. Monitor for 60 seconds
7. Keep simulator running (managed by systemd)

Manage the demo with:
- `just status-demo` - Check if demo is running
- `just logs-demo` - View real-time logs
- `just stop-demo` - Stop the demo service

### Manual Test (Step-by-step)

1. Start Autoware planning simulator in one terminal:
   ```bash
   just start-sim
   ```

2. Wait ~60 seconds for system to initialize

3. In another terminal, run the autonomous driving test:
   ```bash
   just drive
   ```

### Test Sequence Details

The autonomous driving test performs:

1. **Wait for Autoware** - Checks that critical topics are active:
   - `/map/vector_map`
   - `/api/operation_mode/state`
   - `/api/routing/state`

2. **Set Initial Pose** - Publishes to `/initialpose` topic to initialize localization

3. **Wait for Localization** - Waits 5s for localization to stabilize and checks:
   - `/tf` transforms
   - `/localization/kinematic_state`

4. **Set Route** - Calls `/api/routing/set_route_points` service

5. **Engage Autonomous** - Calls `/api/operation_mode/change_to_autonomous` service

6. **Monitor Progress** - Monitors vehicle state for specified duration

### Pose Configuration

Poses are loaded from `poses_config.yaml` in this directory.
These poses are validated for `sample-map-planning`.

## Troubleshooting

### Error: 'autoware' symlink not found
Create the symlink:
```bash
ln -s /path/to/autoware autoware
```

### Error: symlink points to non-existent directory
Update the symlink to point to a valid Autoware installation:
```bash
ln -sf /path/to/autoware autoware
```

### Error: Autoware installation appears to be incomplete
Ensure the symlink points to a built Autoware workspace that contains `install/setup.bash`:
```bash
ls -la autoware/install/setup.bash
```

## Configuration

### justfile Variables

You can override these variables using environment variables:

```bash
MAP_PATH=/path/to/map just start-sim
```

Available variables:
- `MAP_PATH` - Path to map data (default: `$HOME/autoware_map/sample-map-planning`)
- `SERVICE_TIMEOUT` - Container service timeout in seconds (default: 300)
- `LOAD_TIMEOUT` - Node load timeout in milliseconds (default: 60000)

### play_launch Flags

The following flags are used for Autoware testing:

- `--wait-for-service-ready` - Enable container service readiness checking via ROS service discovery
- `--service-ready-timeout-secs 300` - Wait up to 5 minutes for each container service to be ready
- `--load-node-timeout-millis 60000` - Wait up to 60 seconds for each composable node to load

These conservative timeouts are appropriate for Autoware's large number of containers and composable nodes, where DDS initialization can take significant time.

## Comparison Testing

To test different modes:

```bash
# Test simulator only
just start-sim

# Test complete demo (simulator + autonomous test)
just start-demo

# View service logs
just logs-sim   # For simulator service
just logs-demo  # For demo service

# Stop services
just stop-sim   # Stop simulator service
just stop-demo  # Stop demo service
```

All methods use the same:
- Autoware workspace (`autoware/`)
- Map path configuration
- CycloneDDS settings (`cyclonedds.xml`)

This allows you to verify that different launch methods produce equivalent behavior.

### DDS Configuration

All launch methods use `cyclonedds.xml` which configures:
- Localhost-only communication (loopback interface)
- 65.5KB max message size
- 10MB socket buffer size

The `CYCLONEDDS_URI` environment variable is set before launching to ensure all nodes use this configuration.

### Systemd Service Details

Both `just start-sim` and `just start-demo` run as systemd user services:
- Run as user services (no sudo required)
- Automatically source `autoware/install/setup.bash`
- Set `CYCLONEDDS_URI` environment variable
- Copy `DISPLAY` environment variable for GUI applications (e.g., rviz2)
- Can be managed with standard systemd commands:
  ```bash
  # Simulator service
  systemctl --user status autoware-planning-sim
  journalctl --user -u autoware-planning-sim -f
  systemctl --user stop autoware-planning-sim

  # Demo service (simulator + autonomous test)
  systemctl --user status autoware-demo
  journalctl --user -u autoware-demo -f
  systemctl --user stop autoware-demo
  ```

The justfile recipes provide convenient wrappers around these systemd commands.
